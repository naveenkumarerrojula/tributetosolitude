The world will judge my dignities and tragedies,
mistaking my space to loneliness.
I'm waiting to live, living to wait in solitude.
I see my life in silence, the chaos of the quiet,
the wilderness of the stillness and withdrawl from the noise.
We are never meant to be together.
Yet, our hearts promised of the unfair
and broke as they should be.
