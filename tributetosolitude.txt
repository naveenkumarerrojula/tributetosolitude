The world will judge my dignities and tragedies,
mistaking my space to loneliness.
For I let it be, There is nothing in this world to live.
I'm waiting to live, living to wait in solitude.
I see my life in silence, the chaos of the quiet,
the wilderness of the stillness and withdrawl from the noise.
So I pass through the time, hopping on throughts,
thoughts of you and me, we are never meant to be.
Yet, our hearts promised of the unfair
and broke as they should be.
